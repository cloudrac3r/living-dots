# living-dots
Basic life simulator.
The dots seek out olas to eat in order to survive.
In the future, dots on the same team will work together to survive, and to defeat the dots on the other team.
Not eating enough will weaken a dot. As a dot becomes weaker, it can move less frequently. If it becomes too weak, it dies and turns into an ola.
